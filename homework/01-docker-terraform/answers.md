## Question 1. Knowing docker tags

1. Which tag has the following text? - *Automatically remove the container when it exits* 
- `--rm`

## Question 2. Understanding docker first run 

Run docker with the python:3.9 image in an interactive mode and the entrypoint of bash.
Now check the python modules that are installed ( use ```pip list``` ). 

What is version of the package *wheel* ?
- 0.42.0

# Prepare Postgres

Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos
We'll use the green taxi trips from September 2019:

```wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz```

You will also need the dataset with zones:

```wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv```

Download this data and put it into Postgres (with jupyter notebooks or with a pipeline)


## Question 3. Count records 

How many taxi trips were totally made on September 18th 2019?

Tip: started and finished on 2019-09-18. 

Remember that `lpep_pickup_datetime` and `lpep_dropoff_datetime` columns are in the format timestamp (date and hour+min+sec) and not in date.

- 15612

## Question 4. Largest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the largest trip distance
Use the pick up time for your calculations.

- 2019-09-26

## Question 5. Three biggest pick up Boroughs

Consider lpep_pickup_datetime in '2019-09-18' and ignoring Borough has Unknown

Which were the 3 pick up Boroughs that had a sum of total_amount superior to 50000?
 
- "Bronx" "Manhattan" "Queens" 

## Question 6. Largest tip

For the passengers picked up in September 2019 in the zone name Astoria which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip?
We want the name of the zone, not the id.

Note: it's not a typo, it's `tip` , not `trip`

- JFK Airport

## Question 7. Creating Resources

After updating the main.tf and variable.tf files run:

```
terraform apply
```

Paste the output of this command into the homework submission form.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.demo_dataset will be created
  + resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "demo_dataset" {
      + creation_time              = (known after apply)
      + dataset_id                 = "demo_dataset"

      + storage_billing_model      = (known after apply)
      + terraform_labels           = (known after apply)
    }

  # google_storage_bucket.demo-bucket will be created

      + effective_labels            = (known after apply)
      + force_destroy               = true

      + storage_class               = "STANDARD"
      + terraform_labels            = (known after apply)
      + uniform_bucket_level_access = (known after apply)
      + url                         = (known after apply)

      + lifecycle_rule {
          + action {
              + type = "AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload"
            }
          + condition {
              + age                   = 1
              + matches_prefix        = []
              + matches_storage_class = []
              + matches_suffix        = []
              + with_state            = (known after apply)
            }
        }
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
